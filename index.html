  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is the third post in a series about creating a range selector using Shinobi
charts for iOS. If you haven’t already read the previous posts
(<a href="/blog/2013/01/11/building-a-range-selector-with-shinobi-charts-part-i-linking-2-charts/">part I</a>,
<a href="/blog/2013/01/15/building-a-range-selector-with-shinobi-charts-part-ii-creating-custom-handle-annotations/">part II</a>)
I reckon that thisone will make a lot more sense if you do.</p>

<p>The code is available on github at
<a href="https://github.com/sammyd/Shinobi-RangeSelector">github.com/sammyd/Shinobi-RangeSelector</a>, and
combined with a copy of Shinobi charts (or a 30-day demo) from
<a href="http://www.shinobicontrols.com/">shinobicontrols.com</a> you can get the entire
project up and running pretty quickly.</p>

<p>At this point in the project we’ve managed to create 2 charts, one of which
allows the user to interact with the data in the way we’d expect with an iOS chart,
and the other of which has a range selection annotation, which demonstrates which
section of the entire dataset the user is currently viewing. The user is able to
interact with the range selector to change the bounds of the main chart’s view,
as well as the location.</p>

<p>We left off last time with a bug (not really the best practice, but the post was
getting a bit on the long side), which would allow a user to drag the upper range
boundary below the lower:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2013-01-19-range-selector-broken.png" width="761" /></p>

<p>Let’s start off by fixing that, and then we’ll move on to looking at the altogether
more sexy problem of adding momentum to the range selector’s motion. Let’s stop
waffling and get coding…</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In <a href="/blog/2013/01/11/building-a-range-selector-with-shinobi-charts-part-i-linking-2-charts/">part one</a>,
we built a simple app which drew 2 charts from the same data source,
one of which allows user interaction, the other of which has an overlay which 
displays which region of the entire data set the main chart is currently displaying.
If you haven’t read/skimmed it I reckon this post will make a lot more sense if
you do that first. It’s pretty long, but is pretty approachable.</p>

<p>The first post laid a lot of the ground work upon which we can build cool things.
We’ve got some data and some charts, and a range selector annotation. In this post
we’re going to allow users to interact with the range annotation - so that dragging
it will update the range displayed within the main chart. Cool, let’s get on it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I’m not hacking around with electronics and code, I work for Shinobi Controls,
and we make really cool iOS UI components, including mega-tastic charts, grids and
some general purpose components essential for any discerning iOS developer.
However, that’s enough of the advertising (although, it is worth a look - just have
a browse of <a href="http://www.shinobicontrols.com/">shinobicontrols.com</a>).</p>

<p>One of the projects I have been involved in is building
<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/shinobiplay/id545634307">ShinobiPlay</a> - which is an
iPad app available from the app store which provides a developer using Shinobi
a handy set of tools, together with showcasing what the controls are capable of.
One of the most popular demos is called “impress”, which is a chart of a financial
data set. It has a collection of custom-rolled advanced features which are possible
due to the power of Shinobi.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2013-01-11-impress-chart.png" width="1024" /></p>

<p>This short series of blog posts is going to run through
the technical challenges associated with these advanced features. I’ll present these
challenges as a sequence of requirements:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Creating a ‘range selector’. The view is comprised of 2 charts - one shows a
summary of the data, and as such shows the entire data range, superimposed over
which is a ‘range selector window’. The primary chart shows just the data within
this range. Navigating the main chart should update the range selector chart.</li>
  <li>Adding interaction with the range selector. Dragging the range selector should
update the display in the main chart.</li>
  <li>The ends of the range selector should have handles which, when moved, update the
range displayed in the main chart.</li>
  <li>Dragging the range selector should exhibit momentum.</li>
  <li>The main chart should have a horizontal line and text annotation which tracks
the right-most point of the currently visible data.</li>
</ol>

<p>As you can see, we’re going to tackle quite a lot of bits and pieces, so I’ve split
the project into different posts. In this first post we’re going to build the simplest
first iteration of the range selector - by getting 2 charts to ‘talk to each other’.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2013-01-11-simple-range-selector.png" width="384" /></p>

<p>As ever, the code for the completed project is available on
<a href="https://github.com/sammyd/Shinobi-RangeSelector.git">GitHub</a>. It was written in almost
the same order as the write-up, so you can almost follow commit-by-commit. In
order to use Shinobi, you’ll have to get yourself a 30 day free trial of Shinobi
Charts - available on the
<a href="http://www.shinobicontrols.com/shinobicharts/price-plans/shinobicharts-premium/shinobicharts-free-trial-form/">website</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In previous posts on this blog we’ve built a basic environmental monitoring system
which exposes data as a simple JSON webservice. This post is looking at how to
build an iOS app to consume the timeseries data. We’ll establish the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A datasource object which pulls data from a webservice</li>
  <li>Setting the data source to poll for new data</li>
  <li>Create a UI which updates when new data arrives</li>
  <li>Plotting the data in a chart</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/images/2012-12-11-sample-app-chart.png" /></p>

<p>All of this can be applied to any webservice available, but since we have built
something suitable as part of this blog we’ll use that.</p>

<p>We’re working towards building the sample app I’ve put together at 
<a href="https://github.com/sammyd/conair-ios/">github.com/sammyd/conair-ios</a>. I’ll cover
the most salient points, but won’t give an in-depth review of the app’s source code.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This post was originally planned to be about how I’ve adapted the pointer
arithmetic used with standard data a fairly standard data structure to work
well with <code>NSMutableData</code> in objective-C. However, in making a sample project
to demonstrate this, I’ve expanded it a little to speeding up a very specific
type of array in objective-C.</p>

<h2 id="motivation-in-image-processing">Motivation in image processing</h2>

<p>I have been working recently on some image processing algorithms, one of which
required a priority queue of pixel locations. Now, this essentially requires a
list of integers, but since images have lots of pixels, it’s a very long list.
<code>NSArray</code> is a really useful all-purpose collection class used an awful lot
in objective-C. The one ‘restriction’ is that it is a collection of objects - 
it’s not possible to collect primitives in an NSArray without wrapping them in
an object. <code>NSNumber</code> is an object which represents all the different number
types and, more often than not, wrapping your numbers in this is the best way
to go. However, I mentioned that I want to build a list of a large number of
integers (think tens of millions). At this point, the overhead of wrapping
integers in <code>NSNumber</code> to put them in an <code>NSArray</code> becomes significant.</p>

<p>In the past, when doing image processing work, it is at this point I would
drop down to C (from python, matlab, ruby etc) and use low-level memory management
functionality to exactly create the data structures as expected. This is also
an option when using objective-C - it’s just a superset of C, so <code>malloc()</code> and
it’s associated functionality are available to use. However, in using this
we loose all of the memory management functionality made available by
objective-C. There is another way though - <code>NSMutableData</code>.</p>

<h2 id="nsmutabledata-as-a-chunk-of-memory">NSMutableData as a chunk of memory</h2>

<p><code>NSMutableData</code> is a class which provides the user with a writeable contiguous block of
memory of a given size. It inherits from <code>NSObject</code> so the memory management
of reference counting and autorelease pools comes for free. It also has the
advantage that we can ask for the block of memory to be dynamically resized and
iOS will take care of this for us. There is one proviso with this - and that is
that iOS reserves the right to move our block of data (primarily when resize
is requested). This makes perfect sense, but does cause some issues with
standard pointer-based data structures.</p>

<p>In this post I’ll describe how to implement a basic linked-list of integers using
<code>NSMutableData</code> and compare its performance to that of an <code>NSMutableArray</code>
based list.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve written a couple of previous posts about reading the temperature from
and Arduino, storing it in the cloud-based time-series storage engine
<a href="http://tempo-db.com/">TempoDB</a>, and visualising it. However, I haven’t
explained in any detail how to use an Arduino to actually measure the
temperature.</p>

<p>There are several methods available to you - including using digital sensor
chips, some of which just record temperature, some which include other
environmental data such as humidity, and thermocouples, which can be used to
measure extreme temperatures. However, the simplest technique is to
use a thermistor.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This post is part of a series of blog posts detailing how I built a system
which records the temperature in our office. The parts are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/blog/2012/09/23/measuring-the-temperature-with-an-arduino-and-a-thermistor/">Measuring temperature with an Arduino</a>
describes how to use an Arduino and a thermistor to record the temperature.</li>
  <li><a href="/blog/2012/09/14/conair-the-quest-for-reasonable-office-air-con/">ConAir</a>
gives an overview of the motivation behind the project, and runs through the
process of taking the readings from the arduino and publishes them to a TempoDB
database on the internet.</li>
  <li>This post describes building a proxy webservice for the TempoDB database, and
then visualising the temperature data using cubism.js</li>
  <li><a href="/blog/2012/12/11/an-ios-app-for-plotting-live-data-conair-ios/">iOS App</a>
describes building an iOS app which pulls the data from the webservice created
in this app and uses ShinobiCharts to plot the result.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>Hot on the tail of being able to record temperature readings from the
Arduino in the office, we can get some charting on the go.</p>

<p>This post describes building a <a href="http://square.github.com/cubism">cubism.js</a>
front end to a <a href="http://tempo-db.com/">TempoDB</a> API proxy we implement in
Sinatra. You can see the result running live on heroku at
<a href="http://sl-conair.herokuapp.com/">sl-conair</a>, and there’s a screenshot
below in case we’re working on the electronics and there is no data:</p>

<p><img src="/images/2012-09-16-sl-conair.png" /></p>

<p>We have been using <a href="http://tempo-db.com/">TempoDB</a> to store the temperature
data points - it has a great API for querying your dataset, including
rollups, which are able to summarise your data at a resolution of your choice.
Unfortunately, TempoDB doesn’t yet allow public access to datasets - the
API requires authentication for both read and write. Therefore the first
part of this stage will be to build a proxy for the TempoDB API. We then
use Cubism.js to interface this proxied API.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We’re all pretty genial people in our office, however, together with car parking,
one of the topics that is always likely to get a response is the air conditioning.
It’s a regular occurrence for people to be sat coding in their coats, but equally
the meeting cupboard suffers from what can only be described as sauna-like properties.</p>

<p>I decided that I needed to buy a thermometer. I find that life is better with more
data, and that we would all feel a lot better with some facts to backup our complaints.</p>

<h2 id="why-buy-a-thermometer-when-you-can-make-one">Why buy a thermometer, when you can make one?</h2>

<p>I didn’t really want to just measure the temperature, I wanted to chart it. I wanted a
chart of the temperature in lots of different places, all the time. I didn’t want to
spend all day typing readings into a spreadsheet, so I needed to log it automatically.
I needed an Arduino. Luckily my colleague had one - I ordered a thermistor and we were
away.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Having been pretty happy with many years of standard ADSL at about 5 MBit/s, pretty
