Hi. I’m Sam. I have what appears to be a very popular name. Most often I get the Sammy Davis Jr. joke, which I like - he’s a legend.

However, it seems that I’m also a world-class British yachtswoman with a penchant for naked sailing, a welsh Rugby player a cricketer and a meteorologist. I say meteorologist, but she looks more like a weather presenter off’ve the telly…

Anyway, having such a common name is good for some things - I can be pretty much anonymous on the internet without much difficulty, however when it comes to getting user names I can never have my name.

I couldn’t find any sensible twitter usernames - when all I really wanted was my real name :( Anyway, I’m rambling
