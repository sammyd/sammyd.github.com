I like speaking at conferences. I like it rather a lot.

Over the past few years I've presented talks, tutorials and workshops at conferences including the following:

- iOS Dev SG
- Swift Conf
- 360iDev
- iOSCon
- RWDevCon
- iOSDevUK
- CocoaConf

Although I tend to present technical talks, on iOS topics, I'd love to broaden my horizonsâ€”by talking about other technical topics, and less-technical ones too.

## Would you like me to talk at your event?

2017 is looking wide-open at the moment.

If you'd like me to pop along to your conference or meetup and wang on about some random topic, then please [drop me a line](mailto:please@iwantmyreal.name).

Despite my anti-social tendencies, I love to travel to different places and meet different people who share a love and hate relationship with technology.
