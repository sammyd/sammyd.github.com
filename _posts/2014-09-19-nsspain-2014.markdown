In September of 2014 I popped over from the UK to the far sunnier and more
pleasant city of Logro√±o in northern Spain for the second ever edition of
[NSSpain](http://nsspain.com).

Great conference in a really rather nice part of the world. Great talks, great
people and great wine :]

<!-- more -->

I presented a talk entitled __To drawRect or not to drawRect__ - the slides for
which are available on SpeakerDeck at
[speakerdeck.com/sammyd/to-drawrect-or-not-to-drawrect](https://https://speakerdeck.com/sammyd/to-drawrect-or-not-to-drawrect)
or you can see them below:

The accompanying arrow-drawing project is available on Github at
[github.com/sammyd/iOS-ArrowDrawing](https://github.com/sammyd/iOS-ArrowDrawing).

If you're interested in finding more about the different `CALayer` subclasses,
then check out the __LayerCake__ project on github at
