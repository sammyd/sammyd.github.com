Now that the winds from the iOS 8 storm have died down a little we can take a
step back and review what has happened. There are loads of great headline
features such as extensions and handoff, but what about the lesser-known
additions? Some of them are cool new features, whilst some of them will have
broken your existing app.

I presented a talk at [CocoaConf Chicago](http://cocoaconf.com/chicago-2015/home)
that took a look at the underdogs of iOS 8's new features - first discovering
why your apps no longer function as youâ€™d expect, before exploring a
few quick-wins to enhance your apps. It covered topics such as notification
actions, updates in XCTest, presentation of alerts & popovers and more.

Although the slides won't mean a huge amount on their own, they're available on
[SpeakerDeck](https://speakerdeck.com/sammyd/levelling-up-with-ios-8) (and

The sample project is available on GitHub at

Alone, these artefacts might not be be especially useful. If you'd like me to
visit you and present this talk, or a workshop based on the same concepts, then
please do get in touch - [sam@visualputty.co.uk](mailto:sam@visualputty.co.uk).
