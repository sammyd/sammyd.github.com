iOS 8 supports five different screen sizes, and as a developer you should
support all of these. You have a choice: either create five distinct layouts,
or get with the cool kids and learn to love Auto Layout and Adaptive Layout.

I presented a talk at [CocoaConf Chicago](http://cocoaconf.com/chicago-2015/home)
that covered the basics of adaptive layout in interface builder, via a
live-building demo. We covered size classes, installable constraints,
installable views, adaptive fonts and adaptive images in a truly interactive
session.

Although the slides won't mean a huge amount on their own, they're available on
[SpeakerDeck](https://speakerdeck.com/sammyd/hands-on-with-adaptive-layout) (and
below):

The sample project is available on GitHub at
[github.com/sammyd/HandsOnAdaptiveLayout](https://github.com/sammyd/HandsOnAdaptiveLayout).
If you'd like to review the four phases of the development of the adaptive
layout, you can check out the `StarterProject` tag, and then follow along with
the remaining commits.

Alone, these artefacts might not be be especially useful. If you'd like me to
visit you and present this talk, or a workshop based on the same concepts, then
please do get in touch - [sam@visualputty.co.uk](mailto:sam@visualputty.co.uk).
