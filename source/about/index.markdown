Hi. I'm Sam. I have what appears to be a very popular name. Most
often I get the Sammy Davis Jr. joke, which I like - he's a legend.

However, it seems that I'm also a world-class British yachtswoman with a
penchant for naked sailing, a welsh Rugby player a cricketer and a
meteorologist. I say meteorologist, but she looks more like a weather
presenter off've the telly...

Anyway, having such a common name is good for some things - I can be
pretty much anonymous on the internet without much difficulty, however
when it comes to getting user names I can never have my name.

I couldn't find any sensible twitter usernames - when all I really wanted
was my real name :( Anyway, I'm rambling

## Actually about me

I am the Technical Evangelist for [ShinobiControls](http://shinobicontrols.com).
We produce the world's best UI controls and development accelerators for iOS and
Android developers, including hardware accelerated charts, grids and gauges. As
an evangelist I spend my time writing (code, tutorials, blog posts, articles),
speaking (conferences, webinars) and meeting (customers, developers).

I've written a few books for shinobicontrols - you can download them for free:

- [iOS 7: Day-by-day](https://leanpub.com/ios7daybyday)
- [Bitesize Android KitKat](https://leanpub.com/bitesizekitkat)
- [iOS 8: Day-by-Day](http://www.shinobicontrols.com/ios8)

I'm also a member of the [raywenderlich.com](http://www.raywenderlich.com/u/samdavies) 
tutorial team, and was the lead author on the section about Adaptive UI in the
[iOS 8 by Tutorials](http://www.raywenderlich.com/store/swift-tutorials-bundle?source=visualputty) 
book.
