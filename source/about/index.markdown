Hi. I'm Sam. I have what appears to be a very popular name. Most
often I get the Sammy Davis Jr. joke, which I like - he's a legend,
or as Westwood might say:

{% blockquote Tim Westwood, or possibly made up %}
Sammy Davis Jr. - he's big in the game
{% endblockquote %}

However, it seems that I'm also a world-class British yachtswoman with a
penchant for naked sailing, a welsh Rugby player a cricketer and a
meteorologist. I say meteorologist, but she looks more like a weather
presenter off've the telly...

Anyway, having such a common name is good for some things - I can be
pretty much anonymous on the internet without much difficulty, however
when it comes to getting user names I can never have my name.

I couldn't find any sensible twitter usernames - when all I really wanted
was my real name :( Anyway, I'm rambling

## Actually about me

I am the Technical Evangelist for [ShinobiControls](http://shinobicontrols.com).
We produce the world's best UI controls and development accelerators for iOS and
Android developers, including hardware accelerated charts, grids and gauges. As
an evangelist I spend my time writing (code, tutorials, blog posts, articles),
speaking (conferences, webinars) and meeting (customers, developers).

I've written a couple of books for Shinobi - you can download them for free:

- [iOS7: Day-by-day](https://leanpub.com/ios7daybyday)
- [Bitesize Android KitKat](https://leanpub.com/bitesizekitkat)
