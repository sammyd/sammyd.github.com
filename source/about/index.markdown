Hi. I'm Sam. I have what appears to be a very popular name. Most
often I get the Sammy Davis Jr. joke, which I like - he's a legend,
or as Westwood might say:

{% blockquote Tim Westwood, or possibly made up %}
Sammy Davis Jr. - he's big in the game
{% endblockquote %}

However, it seems that I'm also a world-class British yachtswoman with a
penchant for naked sailing, a welsh Rugby player a cricketer and a
meteorologist. I say meteorologist, but she looks more like a weather
presenter off've the telly...

Anyway, having such a common name is good for some things - I can be
pretty much anonymous on the internet without much difficulty, however
when it comes to getting user names I can never have my name.

I couldn't find any sensible twitter usernames - when all I really wanted
was my real name :( Anyway, I'm rambling

## Actually about me

I am a hacker, masquerading as a software developer. I have never been, nor
will I ever be a software developer - I love hacking. I come from an
academic research background (you should look up my papers... oh, wait,
there are lots of papers written by Sam Davies - which one is the real
one?) and hence I've always used whatever tool was suitable for the job
and just churned out throwaway code to discover whether my ideas are correct.

At the end of 2011 I moved out of research to learn how to write software,
and hence am now working as a software developer in Bristol, UK. I am
currently working on iOS projects, but have worked on .NET.

My heart still lies in the world of hacking things together, and I aim
to write some stuff on here about what I do.

I might even tweet one day - who knows?
