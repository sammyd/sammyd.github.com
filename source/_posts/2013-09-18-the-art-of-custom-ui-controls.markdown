At various different events towards the end of 2013 I presented my thoughts on
how to build custom UI controls for mobile devices.

UI controls are really important to designers, developers and users as they
establish a common vocabulary which enables code/ui reuse between distinct
projects. Putting the effort in up-front, with the UX design, the API design and
the software architecture can save vast amounts of effort further down the line.

Creating custom controls doesn't just have to be about providing the functionality
to people outside your team - your other dev users could be yourself in 6 months
time. It's a lot easier to reuse a control which was designed to be suitably
generic as opposed to trying to bastardise an incredibly situation-specific
example.

I have put the slides I presented at [360iDev](http://360iDev.com) in Denver
up only for you to view below. I presented a similar version of the talk in other
fora - including Melbourne Monthly Mobile Meetup, and the Sydney Mobile Meetup.

The presentation has an accompanying iOS project - ShinobiKnob, which is built
around the principles discussed. The source for this is on GitHub at
[sammyd/ShinobiKnob](https://github.com/sammyd/ShinobiKnob). I encourage you to
take a look at it - have a play, fork it, raise some issues, fix them ;) etc.

I'd love to hear any feedback you have - hit my up on twitter
