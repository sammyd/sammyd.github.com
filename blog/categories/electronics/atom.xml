    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve written a couple of previous posts about reading the temperature from
and Arduino, storing it in the cloud-based time-series storage engine
<a href="http://tempo-db.com/">TempoDB</a>, and visualising it. However, I haven’t
explained in any detail how to use an Arduino to actually measure the
temperature.</p>

<p>There are several methods available to you - including using digital sensor
chips, some of which just record temperature, some which include other
environmental data such as humidity, and thermocouples, which can be used to
measure extreme temperatures. However, the simplest technique is to
use a thermistor.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="thermistors">Thermistors</h2>

<p>Thermistors are resistors which are sensitive to heat - i.e. their electrical
resistance changes as the temperature changes. All resistors exhibit this
property, but specialised thermistors are much more sensitive - making it
easier to measure the temperature more accurately. Thermistors come in two varieties:
positive temperature coefficient (PTC) and negative temperature coefficient (NTC).
PTC thermistors are usually used as thermal cut-offs - the resistance increases as
the temperature increases, which is a useful property in safety systems.
NTC are the opposite - the resistance decreases as the temperature increases.
This is the kind of thermistor we use in this project.</p>

<p>We approximate the relationship between temperature and resistance using the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steinhart-Hart_equation">Steinhart-Hart equation</a>:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{1}{T} = A + B\ln(R) + C(\ln(R))^3</script>

<p>where <script type="math/tex">A</script>, <script type="math/tex">B</script> &amp; <script type="math/tex">C</script> are Steinhart-Hart parameters, <script type="math/tex">R</script> is resistance in Ohms
and <script type="math/tex">T</script> is temperature in Kelvin.</p>

<p>For NTC thermistors it’s easier to reformulate this equation as:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{1}{T} = \frac{1}{T_0} + \frac{1}{B} \ln \left( \frac{R}{R_0} \right)</script>

<p>where <script type="math/tex">T_0</script> is the reference temperature of the thermistor (usually 298.15K), <script type="math/tex">B</script>
is the <script type="math/tex">\beta</script> value of the thermistor (available on the datasheet) and <script type="math/tex">R_0</script> is
the resistance at the reference temperature.</p>

<p>The thermistor we’re using in our circuit is a <script type="math/tex">10k\Omega</script>, at the reference temperature
of 25°C (298.15K). It has a B-value of 3977 - which leaves just the
resistance as an unknown.</p>

<h2 id="measuring-resistance">Measuring resistance</h2>

<p>We should all know how to do this. An arduino has multiple analogue input pins,
each of which can sample the potential (or voltage). It digitises these values
and you can read them back via the serial connection (see the Arduino section).</p>

<p>Since we can measure potential, we need to know how we can use this value
to measure resistance. To do this we use a potential divider - one of the simplest
constructs in the world of electronics, and something that everybody has learnt
about at some point in school.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://www.circuitlab.com/circuit/k6x9q7/screenshot/540x405/"></p>

<p>The important fact to recall is that in a series electronic circuit, the current
is constant wherever it is measured, and the potential drops across resistive
components. We apply Ohm’s law (<script type="math/tex">V = IR</script>) to derive the following equation
for the resistance of the 1st resistor:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">R_1 = \frac{R_2 \cdot V_{in}}{V_{out}} - R_2</script>

<p>We use a fixed resistor of 10k for <script type="math/tex">R_2</script>, know the input voltage to be 5V and
use the Arduino to measure the output voltage, so now we know the resistance of the
thermistor, and hence the temperature.</p>

<h2 id="measuring-voltage-with-the-arduino">Measuring voltage with the Arduino</h2>

<p>Arduinos have some analogue to digital converter (ADC) pins. These measure the potential
of a given pin (with reference to the board’s ground) - in layman’s terms - the voltage
at a given point of a circuit. This is exactly what we require for the potential divider
we introduced above.</p>

<p>The image below shows the connections made on the arduino:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2012-09-23-arduino.jpg"></p>

<p>In order to read the value from the ADC pin 0 we write the following code to run on
the Arduino:</p>

<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/3784563.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>/*
* Read analog voltage on pin 0 send to serial port every 3 seconds
*/

const int analogInPin0 = A0; // Analog input pin
int sensorValue0 = 0;

void setup() {
  // initialize serial communications at 9600 bps:
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  // read the analog pin
  sensorValue0 = analogRead(analogInPin0);
  delay(4);

  // print the results to the serial monitor:
  Serial.print(&quot;sensorValue0 = &quot; );
  Serial.println(sensorValue0);

  // wait 3 seconds before the next readings
  delay(3000-4);
}</code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>

<p>This reads the value from the pin and then outputs the specified string to the
serial port. Reading this in python was discussed in a previous
<a href="/blog/2012/09/14/conair-the-quest-for-reasonable-office-air-con/">post</a>.</p>

<p>It is worth mentioning that the ADC is a 10-bit ADC. This means that there are 10 bits
of resolution available in the measurement - i.e. it can be any value from 0 to 1023
(in decimal). The value sent along the serial connection is this integer value, which
needs interpreting in order to translate it into a voltage.</p>

<p>ADCs read the potential in reference to 2 points provided - on the Arduino, the 5V
power supply and ground. Therefore, a reading of 1023 in the ADC represents a potential
of 5V - so converting from a reading <script type="math/tex">x</script> to a potential <script type="math/tex">P</script> is simple:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display"> P = \frac{x}{1023} \cdot 5 </script>

<h2 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting it all together</h2>

<p>So now we’ve built up the theory of thermistors, potential dividers and the Arduino’s ADCs
to describe the technique used to determine the temperature. This is a pretty
simple circuit - there’s a photo of the build here:</p>

<p>Have lots of fun, and feel free to grab any of the code I’ve put up on

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We’re all pretty genial people in our office, however, together with car parking,
one of the topics that is always likely to get a response is the air conditioning.
It’s a regular occurrence for people to be sat coding in their coats, but equally
the meeting cupboard suffers from what can only be described as sauna-like properties.</p>

<p>I decided that I needed to buy a thermometer. I find that life is better with more
data, and that we would all feel a lot better with some facts to backup our complaints.</p>

<h2 id="why-buy-a-thermometer-when-you-can-make-one">Why buy a thermometer, when you can make one?</h2>

<p>I didn’t really want to just measure the temperature, I wanted to chart it. I wanted a
chart of the temperature in lots of different places, all the time. I didn’t want to
spend all day typing readings into a spreadsheet, so I needed to log it automatically.
I needed an Arduino. Luckily my colleague had one - I ordered a thermistor and we were
away.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="electronics">Electronics</h2>
<p>The Arduino board we have has 5 analog input pins, the voltage of which is sampled
with an ADC (Analog to Digital Convertor) and can then be written our via a serial port.
I’ll do another blog with more detail of the electronics - including the Arduino code.
There’s a pretty good tutorial on <a href="http://learn.adafruit.com/thermistor/overview">Adafruit</a>.</p>

<h2 id="lets-get-this-into-python">Let’s get this into Python</h2>
<p>Python is a great language for this kind of work. The electronics setup resulted in an
arduino pushing the ADC value from across the thermistor (in a potential divider setup)
to the serial port every 3 seconds. The line we’re interested in looks like:</p>

<pre><code>sensorValue: 453
</code></pre>

<p>Python’s PySerial is a library for reading from the serial port. Install it:</p>

<pre><code>$ pip install pyserial
</code></pre>

<p>The following code uses PySerial to open the serial port, before listening as lines
arrive. When a line arrives, it checks whether it is of the right format, and if
it is, then pull off the value and print it out.</p>

<p>These sensor values measure the potential across the thermistor, and is a 10-bit
measurement as a proportion of the board’s power supply. This means that the maximum
reading is 1023, and this corresponds to a potential of that of the power supply - which
should be 5V. We need to convert this into the resistance of the thermistor, and then on
to a temperature. We use the following python method:</p>

<p>All the temperature calculations are performed in Kelvin, and the function returns
the temperature in degrees centigrade. This calculation assumes that the thermistor
is on the ground side of the potential divider. The constants are all from a datasheet.</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-time-series">Creating a Time Series</h2>

<p>Now we’ve got the temperature calculations working, we need to come up with somewhere
to save them. Fortunately there is what looks to be a perfect cloud-based solution
for this, in <a href="http://tempo-db.com/">TempoDB</a>. TempoDB is an alumnus of the inaugural
class of TechStars, and is based in Chicago. It offers a simple API for exactly this
kind of data - time series.</p>

<p>They have a nice python client to install</p>

<pre><code>$ pip install tempodb
</code></pre>

<p>And then it’s pretty simple to set up some code to post readings:</p>

<p>Since the Arduino is going to be taking readings every 3 seconds, this is going to
result in rather a lot of data, so in the final version we add an array to buffer
20 such readings, and therefore post the mean of each minute:</p>

<p>So, the result of all this, is a nice graph, of temperature over time for the
first day of operation. This is the chart provided by TempoDB by default - it’s on
our todo list to improve the charting using our own front end, but this is a cool
result for not much work at all.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2012-09-14-office-temp.png"></p>

<p>It’s pretty easy to see when the sun came out (at this stage the thermistor is
just sat on my desk next to the window) and also when the aircon turned off
for the weekend.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>This was a lot more fun than just buying a thermometer, and there’s so much more to
do:
* I’ve got a humidity sensor as well, so once I’ve built the circuitry for that
then we’ll be adding another series to this dataset.
* d3.js is an amazing data-driven javascript utility. I want to learn how to use it
so will be plotting this data using that, in a place everybody can access it.

as we start to collect more time series data.</p>
